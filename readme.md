### What is this?

This repo contains small side-by-side sample code comparing two approaches to react:
- ES6, component classes, redux
- TypeScript, functional components, hooks

### Background

Previously, we would develop react components using ES6 classes and their built-in lifecycle methods. When component state became too complex, we would introduce redux for pure, functional, app-wide state management.

With react hooks and the popularity of TypeScript, the previous approach is now outdated. It may be hard to conceptualize an implementation using a new approach, which is why these samples exist. These samples hopefully demonstrate situations in which the new approach decreases complexity and improves readability.
